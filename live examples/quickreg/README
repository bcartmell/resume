This code is for a system called 'quick-reg'.
It is a simple product and user registration app for internal use.
It allows agents of the company to quickly process multiple registrations
from paper-cards without page refreshes.
Because some customers prefer to fill out a paper card 
and send it in the mail to using the website.
It makes server calls Asyncronously so that users can immediatly begin 
the next registration after clicking the submit button for the last.
It also provides some helper functions like a fake-email-generator
bound to a hot-key because the customer may not have provided one,
but the Registria platform requires it.

'Frauto' is short for 'Front-end Autocomplete' 
it's a front-end auto-complete module that I also built,
It can be seen in action at my.nordictrack.com, it is used
on the 'Model Number' and 'Purchased at' fields.

Code developed by me is in the 'quickReg' folder.  
The 'quickReg_files' folder contains libraries and packaged code that is
standard for all Registria projects.
