# Resume

My resume site.  

Implemented without any external library's or plugins (except LESS).

Because I wanted the challenge and the learning experience of doing it the hard
way.


### Things left to do
- [ ] Add touch events to dragLine so that mobile users can scroll images
- [ ] Add thumnails and lazy-loading for images to improve load time and ios performance
- [ ] Add swiping for changing slides, then remove those ugly next/previous buttons
- [ ] Build events manager and Re-architect JavaScript, things are too tightly coupled.
