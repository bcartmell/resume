          I am an talented and enthusiastic web developer with over six 
          years professional experience designing and implementing web interfaces
          for end-user portals, online stores, and professional services 
          scheduling apps.  I have delivered projects for industry leading 
          and globally recognized brands such as Nest, Whirlpool,
          and Icon Fitness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love learning new technologies and techniques,
          and finding creative solutions to unique problems.
          But most of all, I love building great UI's and 
          web-apps that put the user first.
          I have extensive experience with traditional front-End
          technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap,
          and I am well adapted to learning new technologies and techniques
          for the success of the project.

                Professional services scheduling build on Angular 1.0
                The Nest Insteller finder integrated with data from the Nest
                Installer portal to help end-users find a certified installer
                for a new or pre-purchased Nest Learning Thermostat.
                this was my first Angular project and worked in two languages
                (English and French).  It was coded by me from scratch
                to be a perfect-pixel match of mock-ups provided by Nest on
                both desktop and mobile devices.
                The Nest Installer finder also makes heavy use of Ajax and jQuery
                to provide dynamic behaviors.

                The Nest Installer Portal served as the primary point-of-contact
                between Nest and  Nest Certified installers.  It facilitated the
                ability for certified installers to view, accept, and track
                install requests; order thermostats, apperal, and marketing
                materials; provided training and certification; tracked installer
                ratings; and implemented a custom currency (Nest Points).  I coded
                the portal UI from scratch pixel-perfect to mockups and style
                guidlines provided by Nest.  The portal supported both English and
                French, makes heavy use of Ajax and jQuery, is responsive
                and supports all modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices.

                Multi-brand product registration and e-comerce portal for several
                brands in the Icon Fitness and other brands in the Icon family: 
                NordicTrack, Proform Fitness, and Freemotion Fitness.
                This project was fun and challenging as all brands share the same
                implementation.  
                A liquid tag adds a class to the body tag which CSS uses to
                change styling.  This technique is also used to restrict
                registerable products as well as the products displayed
                on a users 'My Products' page. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Another challenge of the Icon Fitness portal was managing complex
                requirements for extended warranty offerings including sku's,
                pricing structures, and warranty term that change during
                the product life-cycle as part of a data-driven marketing program.

                This portal also makes heavy use of  Ajax requests and jQuery 
                to provide dynamic behaviors and features my own 
                custom-built, full-featured auto-complete feature named
                Frauto-complete for product and address information.
                The Icon fitness portal also makes heavy use of Ajax and jQuery
                to provide dynamic behaviors, is responsive, and supports all
                modern browsers on desktop and mobile devices.

                the Ferguson Crest winery, the winery that Fergy and her fatheer
                opened together. This site was built according to mockups
                provided by Ferguson Crest.  It also included some advanced image
                manipulation for bottles depicted on the store pages and on the
                home page as not all of the bottles had labels at the time of the
                store build.

                This portal included some fun features to build such a dynamic
                mega-menu and many different variation of each product which lead
                to complex sku selection based on many factors.

                A product registration and app distribution portal for Bushnell's 
                BackTrack DTOUR GPS device which supports translations for five
                different languages.

                This was one of my early projects with Registria, and the first
                one that I had the pleasure of designing myself.

                It has since been reimplemented in several variations as new 
                variations (HuntTrack, and FishTrack) have been released.
